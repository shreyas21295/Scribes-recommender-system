# Scribes-recommender-system
A recommender system for students to get lectures notes and scribes personalized with three options(Easy, medium and Hard)

There are two important files, recommender.py and imports.py. Need to have both of these files in the same folder for it to work. The recommender.py contains the core of the project.

It could be either run on command prompt or as a module. On command promt the arguments are optional, make changes in the main file to get results for that query and specify the difficulty level. The script returns top 5 urls as a result.
